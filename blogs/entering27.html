            <h1 class="post-title">thanking 26 and planning 27</h1>
            <div class="post-date">19 Oct, 2024</div>
            <div class="post-content">
                <p>the year 2024 has been an incredible experience for me so far. I managed to pull off most of the things I had planned, and a few that I hadn't. I'm documenting my journey to stay grateful for everything this year has given me while ensuring I keep the momentum going into the next.</p>
                <p>list of things I am <b>proud</b> and <b>grateful</b> for:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>after spending nearly two and a half years working from home, I pushed myself to make a change and moved to new citiesâ€”Mysuru, Hassan, Chennai, and Bangalore. each place brought new experiences and taught me more than I could have imagined. from learning to cook my own meals to meeting new people on weekends, attending social dance sessions, and photographing interesting things, it's been a year <em>full of firsts</em>.</li>
                    <li>for a long time, I hesitated to invest in a dedicated camera. it felt risky to spend my hard-earned money on something when I wasn't even sure if my interest would last. but thanks to a windfall from TTL's IPO last year, I finally took the plunge. looking back, it was <em>one of the best decisions</em> I've made. my camera has become my travel companion, helping me connect with like-minded people and experiment with different styles, such as <em>street</em>, <em>astrophotography</em>, and <em>portraits</em>.</li>
                    <li>after taking some time to heal from a past breakup, I finally felt ready to start dating again this year. it was a big step forward for me. although none of the dates turned into anything serious, the experiences taught me a lot about what I'm looking for and, more importantly, <em>about myself</em>. this is an area I want to explore further in the coming year.</li>
                    <li>one of the biggest milestones this year has been starting the construction of a new home for my family. it's been a <em>long-held dream</em> for my mom and grandma to have a place of their own, and now that dream will finally come true in just a few months.</li>
                    <li>I took a bold step this year by resigning from my (safe) job at Tata. from here onwards it's going to be a demanding phase in my career. I'm currently serving my notice period with some offers in hand and looking for better opportunities.  </li>
                    <li>this year I got a chance to witness a <em>rocket launch</em> for the first time at the Satish Dhawan Space Centre. it was the launch of the INSAT-3DS weather satellite on the GSLV MK II. it was an amazing experience and want to do more of this in future.</li>
                    <li>I have upgraded my workstation for the first time by investing in some expensive items. I added <em>a new monitor</em>, <em>a wireless mechanical keyboard</em>, and my first flagship headphones, <em>Sony's XM5</em>. I must say that my productivity has definitely increased after these upgrades.</li>
                    <li>I finally got to attend a live show of my favorite (tamil) singer, <em>Kaber Vasuki</em> (at Blr).</li>
                    <li>though it may seem small, I'm proud of committing to some simple daily habits like <em>brushing my teeth twice a day</em>, adding curd into my diet in the form of <em>yogurt</em> and <em>lassi</em> and improving my <em>clean day streak</em>.</li>
                </ul> 
                <p>today, as i enter my 27th year on this planet, I want to cross even more milestones by this time next year.</p>
                <p>as far as my career is concerned, I've already built 5 years of experience in CAD automation, and now I'm looking to expand by exploring AI applications in CAD. This year promises to be a demanding phase, and I'm committed to achieving the following goals:</p>
                <p><b>primary:</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>dedicate at least <em>5 hours</em> per week to study Linear Algebra (<em>via Khan Academy</em>) and Computational Geometry (<em>via YouTube lectures</em>).</li>
                    <li>get a basic understanding of automation in other CAD software such as <em>NX</em>, <em>Inventor</em>, and <em>CATIA.</em></li>
                    <li>develop cloud-based CAD automation tools using Python.</li>
                    <li>create a course on building automation applications for Creo.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><b>secondary:</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>gain experience with cloud-based CAD software like <em>Onshape</em> or <em>Autodesk Fusion 360.</em></li>
                    <li>learn Model-Based Definition (MBD).</li>
                    <li>explore integrating CAD with PLM systems.</li>
                    <li>explore the basics of R (low priority).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>outside of my career goals, here are some personal objectives I want to stay committed to this year:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>keep up the momentum I've already built by dedicating at least 1.5 hours a day, five days a week, to fitness in any form. the goal is simply to stay active every day.</li>
                    <li>increase my clean days streak to a minimum of 90 days.</li>
                    <li>build a reading habit. when I can't dedicate specific time, I'll read while traveling, during calm evenings, or whenever there's a free moment. choose books wisely to make the time count.</li>
                    <li>interact with more people to expand my social circle and build confidence in asking people out if I'm interested.</li>
                    <li><s>buy a bike for long rides and make sure it sticks with my financial goals</s> bought a 3 year old <em>RE Classic 350 Reborn</em>!.</li>
                    <li>learn how to drive a four-wheeler.</li>
                    <li>set up a monthly investment plan and stick to it consistently.</li>
                    <li><s>plan an international trip</s> went on my first international trip to Dubai on Dec 2024. </li>
                    <li>improve my photography skills by adding a prime lens to my gear.</li>
                </ul>
