            <div class="post-content">
                <p>the year 2024 has been an incredible experience for me so far. I managed to pull off most of the things I had planned, and a few that I hadn't. I want to document this journey to stay grateful for everything this year has given me, while ensuring I keep the momentum going into the next.</p>
                <p>list of things i am grateful for:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>after spending nearly two and a half years working from home, I pushed myself to make a change and moved to new cities—Mysuru, Hassan, Chennai, and Bangalore. each place brought new experiences and taught me more than I could have imagined. from learning to cook my own meals to meeting new people on weekends, attending social dance sessions, and photographing strangers, it's been a year full of firsts.</li>
                    <li>for a long time, I hesitated to invest in a dedicated camera. it felt risky to spend my hard-earned money on something when I wasn't even sure if my interest would last. but thanks to a windfall from TTL's IPO last year, I finally took the plunge. looking back, it was one of the best decisions I've made. my camera has become a constant companion, helping me connect with like-minded people and capture life in new ways. </li>
                    <li>after taking some time to heal from a past breakup, I finally felt ready to start dating again this year. it was a big step forward for me. although none of the dates turned into anything serious, the experiences taught me a lot about what I'm looking for and, more importantly, about myself. this is an area I'm excited to explore further in the coming year. </li>
                    <li>one of the biggest milestones this year has been starting the construction of a new home for my family. it's a long-held dream for my mom and grandma to have a place of their own, and now that dream will finally come true in just a few months.</li>
                    <li> i took a bold step this year by resigning from my (safe)job at Tata. it's a decision that marks the beginning of a more demanding phase in my career. I'm currently serving my notice period and actively seeking overall better opportunities that fulfill my needs.  </li>
                    <li>on February 17th, I experienced a rocket launch for the first time at the Satish Dhawan Space Centre. it was the launch of the INSAT-3DS weather satellite on the GSLV MK II, and it's a moment I'll always remember. </li>
                    <li>I hadn't upgraded my workstation in years, but I finally did. I added a new monitor, a wireless mechanical keyboard, and my first flagship headphones, Sony's XM5.</li>
                    <li>I finally got to attend a live show of my favorite singer, Kaber Vasuki. (at blr)</li>
                    <li>though it may seem small, I'm proud of committing to simple daily habits—brushing my teeth twice a day and incorporating curd into my diet in the form of yougurt and lassi.</li>
                </ul> 
                <p>Today, as I enter my 27th year on this earth, I'm taking an oath to cross even more milestones by this time next year.</p>
