            <div class="post-content">
                <p>the year 2024 has been an incredible experience for me so far. I managed to pull off most of the things I had planned, and a few that I hadn't. I'm documenting my journey to stay grateful for everything this year has given me while ensuring I keep the momentum going into the next.</p>
                <p>list of things I am proud and grateful for:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>after spending nearly two and a half years working from home, I pushed myself to make a change and moved to new citiesâ€”Mysuru, Hassan, Chennai, and Bangalore. each place brought new experiences and taught me more than I could have imagined. from learning to cook my own meals to meeting new people on weekends, attending social dance sessions, and photographing interesting things, it's been a year full of firsts.</li>
                    <li>for a long time, I hesitated to invest in a dedicated camera. it felt risky to spend my hard-earned money on something when I wasn't even sure if my interest would last. but thanks to a windfall from TTL's IPO last year, I finally took the plunge. looking back, it was one of the best decisions I've made. my camera has become my travel companion, helping me connect with like-minded people and experiment with different styles, such as street, astrophotography, and portraits.</li>
                    <li>after taking some time to heal from a past breakup, I finally felt ready to start dating again this year. it was a big step forward for me. although none of the dates turned into anything serious, the experiences taught me a lot about what I'm looking for and, more importantly, about myself. this is an area I want to explore further in the coming year.</li>
                    <li>one of the biggest milestones this year has been starting the construction of a new home for my family. it's been a long-held dream for my mom and grandma to have a place of their own, and now that dream will finally come true in just a few months.</li>
                    <li>I took a bold step this year by resigning from my (safe) job at Tata. from here onwards it's going to be a demanding phase in my career. I'm currently serving my notice period with some offers in hand and looking for better opportunities.  </li>
                    <li>this year I got a chance to witness a rocket launch for the first time at the Satish Dhawan Space Centre. it was the launch of the INSAT-3DS weather satellite on the GSLV MK II. it was an amazing experience and wanted to do more of this in future.</li>
                    <li>I have upgraded my workstation for the first time by investing in some expensive items. I added a new monitor, a wireless mechanical keyboard, and my first flagship headphones, Sony's XM5. I must say that my productivity has definitely increased after these upgrades.</li>
                    <li>I finally got to attend a live show of my favorite (tamil) singer, Kaber Vasuki (at Blr).</li>
                    <li>though it may seem small, I'm proud of committing to some simple daily habits like brushing my teeth twice a day, adding curd into my diet in the form of yogurt and lassi and improving my clean day streak.</li>
                </ul> 
                <p>Today, as I enter my 27th year on this earth, I'm taking an oath to cross even more milestones by this time next year.</p>
