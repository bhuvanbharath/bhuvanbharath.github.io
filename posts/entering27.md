# thanking 26 and planning 27

**19 Oct, 2024**

the year 2024 has been an incredible experience for me so far. I managed to pull off most of the things I had planned, and a few that I hadn't. I'm documenting my journey to stay grateful for everything this year has given me while ensuring I keep the momentum going into the next.

list of things I am **proud** and **grateful** for:

- after spending nearly two and a half years working from home, I pushed myself to make a change and moved to new cities—Mysuru, Hassan, Chennai, and Bangalore. each place brought new experiences and taught me more than I could have imagined. from learning to cook my own meals to meeting new people on weekends, attending social dance sessions, and photographing interesting things, it's been a year *full of firsts*.

- for a long time, I hesitated to invest in a dedicated camera. it felt risky to spend my hard-earned money on something when I wasn't even sure if my interest would last. but thanks to a windfall from TTL's IPO last year, I finally took the plunge. looking back, it was *one of the best decisions* I've made. my camera has become my travel companion, helping me connect with like-minded people and experiment with different styles, such as *street*, *astrophotography*, and *portraits*.

- after taking some time to heal from a past breakup, I finally felt ready to start dating again this year. it was a big step forward for me. although none of the dates turned into anything serious, the experiences taught me a lot about what I'm looking for and, more importantly, *about myself*. this is an area I want to explore further in the coming year.

- one of the biggest milestones this year has been starting the construction of a new home for my family. it's been a *long-held dream* for my mom and grandma to have a place of their own, and now that dream will finally come true in just a few months.

- I took a bold step this year by resigning from my (safe) job at Tata. from here onwards it's going to be a demanding phase in my career. I'm currently serving my notice period with some offers in hand and looking for better opportunities.  

- this year I got a chance to witness a *rocket launch* for the first time at the Satish Dhawan Space Centre. it was the launch of the INSAT-3DS weather satellite on the GSLV MK II. it was an amazing experience and want to do more of this in future.

- I have upgraded my workstation for the first time by investing in some expensive items. I added *a new monitor*, *a wireless mechanical keyboard*, and my first flagship headphones, *Sony's XM5*. I must say that my productivity has definitely increased after these upgrades.

- I finally got to attend a live show of my favorite (tamil) singer, *Kaber Vasuki* (at Blr).

- though it may seem small, I'm proud of committing to some simple daily habits like *brushing my teeth twice a day*, adding curd into my diet in the form of *yogurt* and *lassi* and improving my *clean day streak*.

today, as i enter my 27th year on this planet, I want to cross even more milestones by this time next year.

as far as my career is concerned, I've already built 5 years of experience in CAD automation, and now I'm looking to expand by exploring AI applications in CAD. This year promises to be a demanding phase, and I'm committed to achieving the following goals:

**primary:**

- dedicate at least *5 hours* per week to study Linear Algebra (*via Khan Academy*) and Computational Geometry (*via YouTube lectures*).
- get a basic understanding of automation in other CAD software such as *NX*, *Inventor*, and *CATIA*.
- develop cloud-based CAD automation tools using Python.
- create a course on building automation applications for Creo.

**secondary:**

- gain experience with cloud-based CAD software like *Onshape* or *Autodesk Fusion 360*.
- learn Model-Based Definition (MBD).
- explore integrating CAD with PLM systems.
- explore the basics of R (low priority).

outside of my career goals, here are some personal objectives I want to stay committed to this year:

- keep up the momentum I've already built by dedicating at least 1.5 hours a day, five days a week, to fitness in any form. the goal is simply to stay active every day.
- build a personolized diet program that helps meet the daily protein intake and other necessary nutrients.
- increase my clean days streak to a minimum of 90 days.
- interact with more people to expand my social circle and build confidence in asking people out if I'm interested.
- ~~set up a monthly investment plan and stick to it consistently.~~
- build a reading habit. when I can't dedicate specific time, I'll read while traveling, during idle evenings, or whenever i find time. choose books wisely to make the time count.
- learn how to drive a four-wheeler.
- upgrade the ~~mobile~~ and laptop.
- improve my photography skills by adding a prime lens to my gear.
- ~~buy a bike for long rides and make sure it sticks with my financial goals~~ bought a 3 year old *RE Classic 350 Reborn*!
- ~~plan an international trip~~ went on my first international trip to Dubai on Dec 2024 along with aj and motta.
