# notes for 2026

**Dec 31, 2025**


before getting into 2026, i want to look back at how 2025 actually went.

it was a good year. not extraordinary, not disappointing either. i managed to do quite a bit, but not everything i thought i would. most of it was about crossing off personal goals, while the career side didn’t get as much attention as it should have received.

### reflections on the past year:

- **finally inaugurated our new home**. this was something i had been thinking about for years. people weren’t exaggerating when they said building a house feels like organizing a wedding. it demanded time, money, and a lot of attention. i also stepped into the **biggest financial commitment** of my life with this home loan. still, no regret at all. this was always meant for my parents. a lot of thought and intention went into this decision. maybe i’ll write about it in detail someday.

- moved to _bangalore_—properly this time. rented a room, cooking my own meal and started going to office regularly. i know how strange this sounds: building a house in my hometown and moving to another city in the same year. but _life doesn’t always follow a straight path, and that’s part of it._

- <span style="color:#B06500">[reltionship]</span> after months of swiping left and right on dating apps, i feel like i might have found some footing. **i’m hoping this works out.** either way, i’m at peace with where things are heading—even if it takes a more _traditional_ turn :)

- explored a lot of food scenes around _bangalore_, largely influenced by what came just before this. weekends naturally started revolving around _food and time together_.

- <span style="color:#B06500">[material]</span> bought a _Samsung s25_, my first premium phone. maybe a small milestone, but a memorable one.

- <span style="color:#B06500">[material]</span> bought the bike (this actually happened in nov ’24). haven’t used it much since i only take it out around home when i visit. aiming to put it to better use in the coming year.

- <span style="color:#B06500">[photography]</span> i spent quite a lot of time roaming the streets of cities like _bangalore_ and _pondicherry_, capturing street moments along the way. more than that, i spent a good amount of time editing them—still a long way to go. i’d say this has definitely improved my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bhuvanbharath.t/" target="_blank">photography</a> skills.

- <span style="color:#0074D9">[career]</span>  in this area, progress was limited. apart from Creo automation, i only scratched the surface of NX and Teamcenter. most of my previous work was sticking to Creo’s native UI styler, but this year i started exploring other UI frameworks and also took on projects involving **C#, .NET** and **Windows native UI frameworks**. this will be a key focus going forward.


for 2026, i’ll focus primarily on career growth, along with a few personal goals. i plan to divide the year into four quarters and set priorities for each. at the end of every quarter, i’ll revisit and update this page.

### 1. Jan - Mar
- <span style="color:#0074D9">[work]</span> complete the development of _#app1_ and _#app2_ and get them production-ready. document everything—**bugs and fixes, architecture** and **key accomplishments**.
- post at least **three tutorials** on Creo automation.
- get a **four-wheeler driving license**.
- purchase a separate **medical insurance** for family members, apart from the corporate one.
- <span style="color:#0074D9">[work]</span> prepare the architecture and development plan for _#app3_ so it’s ready to begin development in the coming days.
- finish the _current read_.
- build a _personalized diet plan_ that helps meet daily protein intake and other necessary nutrients.

### 2. Apr - Jun
- <span style="color:#0074D9">[work]</span> complete the development of _#app3_ and get it ready for production. document the project—**bugs and fixes, architecture** and **accomplishments**.
- post **six tutorials** (two per month) on Creo automation.
- explore NX automation through Siemens courses or by directly going through the API documentation and building an understanding.
- pick up a new read from my existing _sci-fi collection_.

### 3. Jul - Sep
- complete the course or build strong fundamentals in **NX automation**. create hands-on projects integrating **NX** and **PLM**.
- create content applying computational geometry algorithms to real-life use cases.
- explore **PLM automation** through official courses or by diving into the API documentation and experimenting with it.
- ...

### 4. Oct - Dec
