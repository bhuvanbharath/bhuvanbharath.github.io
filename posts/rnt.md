# what i took away from ratan tata

**11 Oct, 2024**

- leading with empathy and truly understanding the needs of others is essential for building lasting, meaningful connections.

- if i ever start a company, i will always prioritize people above everything else.

- i will invest in those who are genuinely solving problems for the underserved and impoverished.

- earth is not solely for humans; we share it with countless other forms of life, and our actions should reflect this understanding.

- i will remember the kind souls who supported me during my growth and strive to reflect that same compassion toward those who are struggling today.

- true immortality lies in living on in the hearts of others, achieved through selfless service to society.
