What do i want out of my life?

to me personally, the life of a person is defined by the work he had done and the people who are benefitted from that. his work should speak for itself even after his demise.





personal:

as i had already built the momentum, i want to keep this consistency by spending at least 1.5 hour/day for fitness. at least move daily.

build a reading habit. if i could not dedicatedly spend time for this, i will try to incorporate during travelling, when getting bored, during some calm evenings.

go out more on the weekends and meet more people to find the right person.  build the confidence to ask people out if interested.

build a solid financial foundation. build a simple investment strategy to invest certain percent every month. invest in stocks, gold and bonds.

help people who struggles to meet the basic needs of life. small things like keeping change in hand whenever i go out. donating things to homes. buying food for children.

take care of friends and family around me. dont think twice before spending for friends. 

move to either Chennai or Bangalore and start living on own.
